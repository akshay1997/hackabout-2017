NOTE:
In the first step i.e. to convert the raw training and test data files into train.txt and test.txt ,
I used the following files:

- TRAIN_FILE.TXT for training
- TEST_FILE_FULL.TXT for testing
I didn't use TEST_FILE_CLEAN.TXT as it was creating problems in the embedding file as the dimensions of the 
training and testing were different. 
When I used TEST_FILE_CLEAN.TXT , everything worked fine except the fact that the embedding file corrupted.
So to resolve that issue, we had to keep the dimensions of train.txt embeddings and test.txt embeddings same.
More importantly my merge layer requires that the layers which it is merging i.e. the embedding layers 
of test set and training set must be of same dimensions. That's why I used TEST_FILE_FULL.TXT.

In this process , I have never used test dataset in training as you can check in the files or even run
the whole program stack. The test set has only been used in the CNNtest.py file in which I am actually predicting the values of test set and computing accuracy by calculating the total number of matched values divided by the size of test daatset.
